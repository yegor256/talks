\lnQuote
  {gary-mcgraw}
  {A central and critical aspect of the computer \ul{security problem} is a software problem. Software defects with security ramifications—including implementation bugs such as buffer overflows and design flaws such as inconsistent error handling—promise to be with us \ul{for years}.}
  {mcgraw2006software}

\lnPitch{\pptSection[3.Dirt]{3. Complexity, Duplication, and Smells}}

\lnQuote
  {vladimir-khorikov}
  {The \ul{simpler} your solution is, the \ul{better} you are as a software developer. Most software developers can write code that works. Creating code that works \ul{and} is as simple as possible --- that is the true challenge.}
  {khorikov2015kiss}

\lnQuote

  {robert-martin}
  {Duplication is the \ul{primary enemy} of a well-designed system.}
  {martin2008clean}

\lnQuote
  [Mark Seemann]
  {mark-seemann}
  {I like the gardening metaphor's emphasis on activities that combat disorder. Just as you must prune and weed a garden, you must refactor and pay off \ul{technical debt} in your code bases.}

\lnPitch{\pptSection[1.Quality]{1. False Sense of Quality}}

\lnQuote
  [Chun Jie Chong]
  {chun-jie-chong}
  {Quality-wise, we found that LLM generates bare-bones code that lacks defensive programming constructs, and is typically \ul{more complex} (per line of code) compared to human-written code. Fuzzing has revealed that LLM-generated code is more \ul{prone to hangs and crashes} than human-written code.}
  {chong2024artificial}

\lnQuote
  [Altaf Allah Abbassi]
  {altaf-allah-abbassi}
  {33.54\% of the studied sample exhibited multiple \ul{inefficiencies}, indicating that inefficiencies in LLM-generated code are diverse and interconnected. Our findings highlight a \ul{critical gap} in LLMs' capability to generate correct, optimized, and high-quality code.}
  {abbassi2025taxonomy}

\lnQuote
  [Adam Alami]
  {adam-alami}
  {Introduction of an LLM into the social system of code review causes a \ul{disruption} to the inherent social dynamics of the process and to the transition of \ul{accountability} from individual to collective.}

\lnQuote
  [Xuanhua Shi]
  {xuanhua-shi}
  {The coding style of human-written code may be influenced by LLMs: they may not only mirror existing norms but also subtly reshape them, gradually pushing human developers toward greater stylistic alignment with \ul{LLM-preferred conventions}.}

  [James Whittaker]
  {james-whittaker}
  {Google centers its development process around code reviews. There is far more \ul{fanfare} about reviewing code than there is about writing it.}
  {whittaker2012google}

\lnQuote
  [\nospell{Caitlin Sadowski}]
  {caitlin-sadowski}
  {A correlation between \ul{change size} and \ul{review quality} is acknowledged by Google and developers are strongly encouraged to make small, incremental changes (with the exception of large deletions and automated refactoring).}

  [Goran Petrovi{\'c}]

  {Google \ul{does not enforce} any code coverage thresholds across the entire codebase. Projects (or groups of projects) are free to define their own thresholds and goals. Many projects opt-into a centralized voluntary alerting system that defines \ul{five levels} of code coverage thresholds.}
