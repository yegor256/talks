\lnQuote
  [Richard Nelson]
  {richard-nelson}
  {Scientific \textcolor{orange}{research} may be defined as the human activity directed toward the advancement of knowledge, where knowledge is of two roughly separable sorts: \begin{inparaenum}[1)]\item \ul{facts or data} observed in reproducible experiments and
  \item \ul{theories or relationships} between data\end{inparaenum}.}

\lnThought*{How do you convince your company to invest into a research project?}

\lnQuote
  [Kenneth Joseph Arrow]
  {kenneth-joseph-arrow}
  {We expect a free enterprise economy to \textcolor{orange}{underinvest} in invention and research (as compared with an \ul{ideal}) because it is risky, because the product can be appropriated only to a limited extent, and because of increasing returns in use. This underinvestment will be greater for more \ul{basic} research.}
  {arrow1972economic}

\lnQuote
  [Bronwyn Hall]
  {bronwyn-hall}
  {First and most importantly, in practice \textcolor{orange}{50\% or more} of R\&D spending is the \ul{wages and salaries} of highly educated \ul{scientists and engineers}. Their efforts create an intangible asset, the firmâ€™s knowledge base, from which profits in future years will be generated. To the extent that this knowledge is `tacit' rather than codified, it is embedded in the human capital of the firm's employees, and is therefore lost if they \ul{leave} or are \ul{fired}.}
