  [Richard Nelson]

  {Scientific \textcolor{orange}{research} may be defined as the human activity directed toward the advancement of knowledge, where knowledge is of two roughly separable sorts: \begin{inparaenum}[1)]\item \ul{facts or data} observed in reproducible experiments and
  \item \ul{theories or relationships} between data\end{inparaenum}.}
  {nelson1959simple}

\lnThought*{While research discovers laws of nature, development exploits them.}

  [Kenneth Joseph Arrow]
  {kenneth-joseph-arrow}
  {We expect a free enterprise economy to \textcolor{orange}{underinvest} in invention and research (as compared with an \ul{ideal}) because it is risky, because the product can be appropriated only to a limited extent, and because of increasing returns in use. This underinvestment will be greater for more \ul{basic} research.}
