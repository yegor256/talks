  {Only about 15\% of comments provided by reviewers indicate a possible defect, much less a blocking defect. Rather, it is feedback related to the long-term code \ul{maintainability} that comprises a much larger portion of comments provided by reviewers; at least 50\% of all.}

  {A correlation between \ul{change size} and \ul{review quality} is acknowledged by Google and developers are strongly encouraged to make small, incremental changes (with the exception of large deletions and automated refactoring).}

  {Google categorizes CRs into specific sizes, these sizes are indicated as part of the code review tool and in the notification to the reviewer of the code change... The general advice is to \ul{split} change requests for \ul{easier} and \ul{quicker} reviews when possible.}

  {Our results show that \ul{valence} (expressed in comments received and posted by a reporter) and \ul{joy} expressed in the comments written by a reporter are linked to a \ul{higher likelihood} of issues to be merged. On the contrary, sadness, anger, and arousal expressed in the comments written by a reporter, and anger, arousal, and dominance expressed in the comments received by a reporter, are linked to a lower likelihood of a pull request to be merged.}

  {Unexpectedly, quality \ul{flaws} measured by PMD turned out not to affect the acceptance of a pull request at all. As suggested by other works, other factors such as the \ul{reputation} of the maintainer and the \ul{importance} of the delivered feature might be more important than other qualities in terms of pull request acceptance.}
